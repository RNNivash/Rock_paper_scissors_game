# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game! ðŸŽ® This simple Python-based game allows you to play the classic game against a computer. Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to showcase basic programming skills, including conditionals, loops, and user input handling.

## About the Game

In this game, youâ€™ll compete against a computer by choosing one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer will randomly select its choice, and the winner is determined by the traditional rules:
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

The game will continue to loop, allowing you to play as many times as youâ€™d like until you choose to exit.

## Code Overview

The game is implemented with a simple Python script. Here's the basic structure:
1. **Random Choice**: The computer makes a random choice each round.
2. **User Input**: You choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. **Conditionals**: The winner is determined using `if-elif-else` statements.
4. **Looping**: The game continues in a loop until you decide to stop playing.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Code**: Copy and paste the code into a Python IDE or text editor.
2. **Make a Choice**: Enter `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` when prompted.
3. **See the Result**: The computerâ€™s choice will be displayed, along with the result of the game.
4. **Play Again or Exit**: After each round, youâ€™ll be asked if youâ€™d like to play again.

## Learning Path

This project is part of my journey to learn Python and build a solid foundation in programming. Here are a few things Iâ€™ve learned by creating this game:
- How to use `random.choice()` to select a random item from a list.
- Using `while` loops to continuously run the game until the user decides to stop.
- Handling user input and validating responses.
- Using conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) to determine the winner.
